    "This first section introduces the two analyzed estimation methods, Causal Forest and Causal KNN, and describes how treatment estimation is conducted. The main problem in settings dealing with causality and inference is the missing counterfactual. Particularly in estimating treatment effects it's only possible to observe an individual with treatment, $Y_i^{(1)}$, or without treatment, $Y_i^{(0)}$, but never both. Therefore, we are in the Potential Outcome Framework where we \"posit the existence of potential outcomes $Y_i^{(1)}$ and $Y_i^{(0)}$ corresponding respectively to\n",
    "the response the $i$-th subject would have experienced with and without the treatment\" (Athey/Wager, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both introduced methods, Causal Forest and Causal KNN, try to find these potential outcomes by some sort of matching algorithm in order to estimate the treatment effect \n",
    "$$\\tau(x) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} \\mid X_i = x\\right] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One essential assumption we need to impose in order to theoretically justify both methods is unconfoundedness, i.e. \"treatment assignment $W_i$ is independent of the potential outcomes for $Y_i$ conditional on $X_i$\" (Athey & Wager 2015).\n",

    "The second simulation introduces some simple treatment effect heterogeneity, that is treatment effect increases if an individual has positive values in its' $X_1$ and $X_2$ characteristics respectively. Each positive value increases the magnitude by the mean treatment effect of 0.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the table below, the Mean Squared Errors almost don't differ from the previous case with homogeneous treatment effects. This result is quite remarkable and shows that both methods are quite good in matching observations with a simple heterogeneity structure. It should be noted that Powers et al. (2017) find some striking differences between Scenarios 1 and 2 in their paper which come closest to my simulations 1 and 2. One reason might be that Powers et al. (2017) draw their regressors mixed from Standard Normal and Bernoulli distributions. "

    "In this scenario magnitude of treatment depends on the values of $X_1$ and $X_2$. So, treatment effect is even heterogeneous within $X_1$ and $X_2$. Higher positive values of these variables imply a higher treatment effect.\n",

Even for a large sample the estimated $MSE_{\\tau}$ is significantly higher than in the previous two cases. "

So, even if one has a high dimensional data set, this simulation study shows that if the number of observations is quite large the Causal Forest will perform quite well. THe relatively well performance of the Causal Forest in high dimensional space can be explained theoretically by it's variable selection feature. By training the trees with only the most \"important\" variables, only a couple variables will be selected by the Causal Tree overall. On the other hand, KNN tries to find the closest neighbors in the Euclidean Space and is therefore not reducing dimensionality. \n",
